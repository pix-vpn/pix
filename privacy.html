                        The service may contain content appropriate for children under the age of 13. As a parent, you

                        that involve the collection or use of personal information. We use reasonable efforts to ensure
                        that before we collect any personal information from a child, the child's parent receives notice
                        of and consents to our personal information practices.

                        the service to these users. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your
                        information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's
                        consent before we collect and use that information.

                        them. If the user is under the age of 13, the service may be either blocked or redirected to a
                        parental consent process.
